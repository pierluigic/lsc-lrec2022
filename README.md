## Lexical Semantic Change: Models, Data and Evaluation


Lexical Semantic Change (LSC) is a phenomenon associated with the diachronic evolution of the meanings of a word. 
In historical linguistics, it is a well-known problem, which is recently gaining momentum also in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Lingustics (CL) communities, thanks to the availability of both large diachronic corpora and evaluation benchmarks.

This tutorial will present an overview of the current approaches, problems and challenges in this research field. The tutorial will consist of two parts. First, we will provide an introduction to Lexical Semantic Change and to the available resources (corpora and data sets) for the study of meanings in diachrony. We will highlight issues in the creation and use of diachronic corpora, as well as different procedure for the annotation of data. In the second part, we will introduce the current state-of-the-art approaches for the automatic detection of LSC and we will provide an hands-on section on available systems and tools.
